ðŸ‘‹ Hey, fellow developers!

You like to #NeverStopLearning and feel that #SharingIsCaring? Then this here is exactly for you! Today, I have the great honor to announce the Teams Toolkit Cloud Skills challenge, which I host for you.

It is an amazing opportunity to take your app development skills to the next level:


## Join us!

Join us from April 12 to April 26 and participate in the challenge to complete the Teams Toolkit learn path on learn.microsoft.com. Not only will you enhance your knowledge and capabilities, but you will also be eligible to win fab prizes, including Microsoft Certification vouchers, Azure credits, and Microsoft Gift Cards.ðŸ’ƒ

By completing the learn path, you will learn how to leverage Teams Toolkit to create bots, tabs, messaging extensions, and more for Microsoft Teams. The learn path consists of 5 modules that take you from zero to hero, providing a comprehensive and in-depth experience that covers everything you need to know to build apps for Teams.

With Teams Toolkit, you can streamline the app development process and make the most of the platform's features, including creating bots that can automate tasks, developing tabs that can display information from external services, and building messaging extensions that enable users to interact with external services from within Teams.

## Contributing

What's more, once you complete the challenge, you will have the opportunity to contribute to the community by creating samples and getting featured on adoption.microsoft.com. This way, you can showcase your skills, help others, and become a recognized member of the community.
